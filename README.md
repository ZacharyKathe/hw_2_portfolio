### I created a web map using Leaflet, JavaScript and html showing my three favorite building at UW. I also have a story map hosted on ArcGIS Online. This story map was created as a final project. I did an analysis on drug addiction and mental illnessness providing maps created in RStudio to highlight the damaging effects. Moreover, I provided an interactive resource map with over 150 in-patient facilities with information on the facility and link to their website.
